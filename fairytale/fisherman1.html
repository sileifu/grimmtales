        <p>There was once upon a time a fisherman who lived with his wife
in a pig-stye close by the sea, and every day he went out fishing.
And he fished, and he fished.  And once he was sitting with his
rod, looking at the clear water, and he sat and he sat.  Then
his line suddenly went down, far down below, and when
he drew it up again, he brought out a large flounder.  Then the
flounder said to him, hark, you fisherman, I pray you, let me
live, I am no flounder really, but an enchanted prince.  What
good will it do you to kill me.  I should not be good to eat, put
me in the water again, and let me go.  Come, said the fisherman,
there is no need for so many words about it - a fish that can
talk I should certainly let go, anyhow.  And with that he put
him back again into the clear water, and the flounder went to the
bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him.  Then the
fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the pig-stye.
Husband, said the woman, have you caught nothing to-day.  No, said
the man, I did catch a flounder, who said he was an enchanted
prince, so I let him go again.  Did you not wish for anything
first, said the woman.  No, said the man, what should I wish
for.  Ah, said the woman, it is surely hard to have to live
always in this pig-stye which stinks and is so disgusting.  You
might have wished for a little hut for us.  Go back and call
him.  Tell him we want to have a little hut, he will certainly
give us that.  Ah, said the man, why should I go there again.
Why, said the woman, you did catch him, and you let him go again.
He is sure to do it.  Go at once.
