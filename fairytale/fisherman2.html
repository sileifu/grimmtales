        <p>The man still did not quite
like to go, but did not like to oppose his wife either, and
went to the sea.
When he got there the sea was all green and yellow, and no
longer so smooth, so he stood still and said,
          flounder, flounder in the sea,
          come, I pray thee, here to me.
          For my wife, good ilsabil,
          wills not as I'd have her will.
Then the flounder came swimming to him and said, well what does
she want, then.  Ah, said the man, I did catch you, and
my wife says I really ought to have wished for something.
She does not like to live in a pig-stye any longer.  She would
like to have a hut.  Go, then, said the flounder, she has it
already.
When the man went home, his wife was no longer in the stye,
but instead of it there stood a hut, and she was sitting on a
bench before the door.  Then she took him by the hand and said
to him, just come inside.  Look, now isn't this a great deal
better.  So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a
pretty little parlor and bedroom, and a kitchen and pantry,
with the best of furniture, and fitted up with the most
beautiful things made of tin and brass, whatsoever was wanted.
And behind the hut there was a  small yard, with hens and ducks,
and a little garden with flowers and fruit.  Look, said the
wife, is not that nice.  Yes, said the husband, and so it shall
remain - now we will live quite contented.  We will think about
that said the wife.  With that they ate something and went to
bed.
Everything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the
woman said, hark you, husband, this hut is far too small for us,
and the garden and yard are little.  The flounder might just as
well have given us a larger house.  I should like to live in a
great stone castle.  Go to the flounder, and tell him to give
us a castle.  Ah, wife, said the man, the hut is quite good
enough.  Why whould we live in a castle.  What. Said the
woman.  Just go there, the flounder can always do that.  No,
wife, said the man, the flounder has just given us the hut,
I do not like to go back so soon, it might make him angry.
Go, said the woman, he can do it quite easily, and will be glad
to do it.  Just you go to him.
