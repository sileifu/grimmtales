        <p>The man's heart grew heavy, and he would not go.  He said to
himself, it is not right, and yet he went.  And when he came
to the sea the water was quite purple and dark-blue, and grey
and thick, and no longer so green and yellow, but it was still
quiet.  And he stood there and said,
          flounder, flounder in the sea,
          come, I pray thee, here to me.
          For my wife, good ilsabil,
          wills not as I'd have her will.
Well, what does she want, now, said the flounder.  Alas, said
the man, half scared, she wants to live in a great stone castle.
Go to it, then, she is standing before the door, said the
flounder.
Then the man went away, intending to go home, but when he
got there, he found a great stone palace, and his wife was
just standing on the steps going in, and she took him by the
hand and said, come in.  So he went in with her, and in the
castle was a great hall paved with marble, and many servants,
who flung wide the doors.  And the walls were all bright with
beautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs and tables
of pure gold, and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling,
and all the rooms and bedrooms had carpets, and food and wine
of the very best were standing on all the tables, so that they
nearly broke down beneath it.  Behind the house, too, there
was a great court-yard, with stables for horses and cows, and
the very best of carriages.  There was a magnificent large
garden, too, with the most beautiful flowers and fruit-trees,
and a park quite half a mile long, in which were stags, deer,
and hares, and everything that could be desired.  Come, said
the woman, isn't that beautiful.  Yes, indeed, said the man,
now let it be, and we will live in this beautiful castle
and be content.  We will consider about that, said the woman,
and sleep upon it.  Thereupon they went to bed.
Next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just daybreak,
and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before
her.  Her husband was still stretching himself, so she poked
him in the side with her elbow, and said, get up, husband,
and just peep out of the window.  Look you, couldn't we be the
king over all that land.  Go to the flounder, we will be the
king.  Ah, wife, said the man, why should we be king.  I
do not want to be king.  Well, said the wife, if you won't be
king, I will.  Go to the flounder, for I will be king.  Ah,
wife, said the man, why do you want to be king.  I do not like
to say that to him.  Why not, said the woman.  Go to him this
instant.  I must be king.
