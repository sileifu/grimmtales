        <p>So the man went, and was quite
unhappy because his wife wished to be king.  It is not right,
it is not right, thought he.  He did not wish to go, but yet
he went.
And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark-grey, and the
water heaved up from below, and smelt putrid.  Then he went
and stood by it, and said,

          flounder, flounder in the sea,
          come, I pray thee, here to me.
          For my wife, good ilsabil,
          wills not as I'd have her will.
Well, what does she want, now. Said the flounder.  Alas, said
the man, she wants to be king.  Go to her.  She is king
already.
So the man went, and when he came to the palace, the castle
had become much larger, and had a great tower and magnificent
ornaments, and the sentinel was standing before the door, and
there were numbers of soldiers with kettle-drums and trumpets.
And
when he went inside the house, everything was of real marble
and gold, with velvet covers and great golden tassels.  Then
the doors of the hall were opened, and there was the court in
all its splendor, and his wife was sitting on a high throne
of gold and diamonds, with a great crown of gold on her head,
and a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand, and on
both sides of her stood her maids-in-waiting in a row, each
of them always one head shorter than the last.
Then he went and stood before her, and said, ah, wife, and
now you are king.  Yes, said the woman, now I am king.  So
he stood and looked at her, and when he had looked at her thus
for some time, he said, and now that you are king, let all else
be, now we will wish for nothing more.  No, husband, said the
woman, quite anxiously, I find time passes very heavily, I can
bear it no longer.  Go to the flounder - I am king, but I must
be emperor, too.  Oh, wife, why do you wish to be emperor.
Husband, said she, go to the flounder.  I will be emperor.
Alas, wife, said the man, he cannot make you emperor.  I may not
say that to the fish.  There is only one emperor in the land.  An
emperor the flounder cannot make you.  I assure you he cannot.
What. Said the woman, I am the king, and you are nothing but
my husband.  Will you go this moment.  Go at once.  If he can
make a king he can make an emperor.  I will be emperor.  Go
instantly.  So he was forced to go.
