        <p>As the man went, however, he
was troubled in mind, and thought to himself, it will not end
well.  It will not end well.  Emperor is too shameless.  The
flounder will at last be tired out.
With that he reached the sea, and the sea was quite black and
thick, and began to boil up from below, so that it threw up
bubbles, and such a sharp wind blew over it that it curdled, and
the man was afraid.  Then he went and stood by it, and said,
          flounder, flounder in the sea,
          come, I pray thee, here to me.
          For my wife, good ilsabil,
          wills not as I'd have her will.
Well, what does she want, now, said the flounder.  Alas, flounder,
said he, my wife wants to be emperor.  Go to her, said the
flounder.  She is emperor already.
So the man went, and when he got there the whole palace was made
of polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments,
and soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets,
and beating cymbals and drums.  And in the house, barons, and
counts, and dukes were going about as servants.  Then they opened
the doors to him, which were of pure gold.  And when he
entered, there sat his wife on a throne, which was made of one
piece of gold, and was quite two miles high.  And she wore a great
golden crown that was three yards high, and set with diamonds and
carbuncles, and in one hand she had the sceptre, and in the
other the imperial orb.  And on both sides of her stood the
yeomen of the guard in two rows, each being smaller than the one
before him, from the biggest giant, who was two miles high, to the
very smallest dwarf, just as big as my little finger.  And
before it stood a number of princes and dukes.
Then the man went and stood among them, and said, wife, are you
emperor now.  Yes, said she, now I am emperor.  Then he stood
and looked at her well, and when he had looked at her thus for
some time, he said, ah, wife, be content, now that you are
emperor.  Husband, said she, why are you standing there.  Now, I
am emperor, but I will be pope too.  Go to the flounder.  Oh,
wife, said the man, what will you not wish for.  You cannot be
pope.  There is but one in christendom.  He cannot make you pope.
Husband, said she, I will be pope.  Go immediately, I must be
pope this very day.  No, wife, said the man, I do not like to
say that to him.  That would not do, it is too much.  The flounder
can't make you pope.  Husband, said she, what nonsense.  If he
can make an emperor he can make a pope.  Go to him directly.
I am emperor, and you are nothing but my husband.  Will you go
at once.
Then he was afraid and went, but he was quite faint, and
shivered and shook, and his knees and legs trembled.  And a high
wind blew over the land, and the clouds flew, and towards evening
all grew dark, and the leaves fell from the trees, and the water
rose and roared as if it were boiling, and splashed upon the
shore.  And in the distance he saw ships which were firing guns
in their sore need, pitching and tossing on the waves.  And yet
in the midst of the sky there was still a small patch of blue,
though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm.  So,
full of despair, he went and stood in much fear and said,
          flounder, flounder in the sea,
          come, I pray thee, here to me.
          For my wife, good ilsabil,
          wills not as I'd have her will.
Well, what does she want, now, said the flounder.  Alas, said the
man, she wants to be pope.  Go to her then, said the flounder,
she is pope already.
So he went, and when he got there, he saw what seemed to be a
large church surrounded by palaces.  He pushed his way through
the crowd.  Inside, however, everything was lighted up with
thousands and thousands of candles, and his wife was clad in
gold, and she was sitting on a much higher throne, and had three
great golden crowns on, and round about her there was much
ecclesiastical splendor.  And on both sides of her was a row of
candles the largest of which was as tall as the very tallest tower,
down to the very smallest kitchen candle, and all the emperors
and kings were on their knees before her, kissing her shoe.
Wife, said the man, and looked attentively at her, are you now
pope.  Yes, said she, I am pope.  So he stood and looked at her,
and it was just as if he was looking at the bright sun.  When he
had stood looking at her thus for a short time, he said, ah,
wife, if you are pope, do let well alone.  But she looked as
stiff as a post, and did not move or show any signs of life.
Then said he, wife, now that you are pope, be satisfied, you
cannot become anything greater now.  I will consider about that,
said the woman.  Thereupon they both went to bed, but she was
not satisfied, and greediness let her have no sleep, for she
was continually thinking what there was left for her to be.
The man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a great
deal during the day.  But the woman could not fall asleep at
all, and flung herself from one side to the other the whole
night through, thinking always what more was left for her to
be, but unable to call to mind anything else.  At length the
sun began to rise, and when the woman saw the red of dawn,
she sat up in bed and looked at it.  And when, through the
window, she saw the sun thus rising, she said, cannot I, too,
order the sun and moon to rise.  Husband, she said, poking him
in the ribs with her elbows, wake up.  Go to the flounder, for
I wish to be even as God is.  The man was still half asleep,
but he was so horrified that he fell out of bed.  He thought
he must have heard amiss, and rubbed his eyes, and said, wife,
what are you saying.  Husband, said she, if I can't order the
sun and moon to rise, and have to look on and see the sun
and moon rising, I can't bear it.  I shall not know what it is
to have another happy hour, unless I can make them rise myself.
Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder ran over
him, and said, go at once.  I wish to be like unto God.  Alas,
wife, said the man, falling on his knees before her, the flounder
cannot do that.  He can make an emperor and a pope.  I beseech
you, go on as you are, and be pope.  Then she fell into a
rage, and her hair flew wildly about her head, she tore open her
bodice, kicked him with her foot, and screamed, I can't stand
it, I can't stand it any longer.  Will you go this instant.
